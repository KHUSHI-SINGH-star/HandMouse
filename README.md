Because the future doesn’t click — it gestures.

Control your computer like a sci-fi movie:
✋ Wave to move the cursor
✌️ Signal to double-click
🤏 Pinch to capture the screen

No mouse. No keyboard. Just you, your hand, and pure Python wizardry.

⚙️ Developer-Friendly & Powerful
AirControl is a gesture-powered desktop controller using OpenCV & MediaPipe.
Perform actions like mouse movement, double-click, volume control, and screenshot — all with your bare hand.

It's like turning your webcam into an invisible remote. Built for makers, hackers, and human-computer interface enthusiasts.

✨ Short & Catchy (for GitHub repo tagline box)
✋ Touchless desktop control using your hand + Python magic.
Wave. Click. Snap. Control.

🤹‍♀️ Playful & Trendy
Tired of clicking? Try waving.

With AirControl, you don’t need devices — your hand is the device.
